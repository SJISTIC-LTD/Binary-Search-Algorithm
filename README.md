# Binary-Search-Algorithm
The name is evident enough to give an overview of the project. The program requires you to create a list of numbers between 0 to whatever range you prefer, with every succeeding number having a difference of 2 between them. 

When the user inputs a random number to be searched the program begins its search by dividing the list into two halves. The first half is searched for the required number and if found, the other half is rejected and vice versa. The search continues until the number is found or the subarray size becomes zero. This Python project idea could also help you write a program to search an element in the list.
